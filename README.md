# Household-Stock-Holding_Prediction-with-Logistic-and-Polynomial-Regressions-and-Deep-Learning

I estimate household consumption using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Dataset. Household consumption data is very noisy. I combine the Ridge Regression with the Polynomial Regression. The Polynomial of degree 3 produces the best result.

Moreover, I estimate household's stock market participation decision using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Dataset. I combine the Logistic Regression with the Polynomial Regression. The Polynomial of degree 3 produces the best result.

Finally, I build the Deep Learning model with 3 layers and each layer is with 50 units. Relu activation function is used as the activation function. For the last output layer, the sigmoid functions is used as the activation function. We can see that the Dense Deep Learning model produces slightly better result than the combination of Logistic and Polynomial Regressions.
